// Create a variable named fee and assign 125000 to it.
// Create another variable discountPercent and assign 10 to it.
// Compute discount and assign it to the discount variable.
// Compute and print the fee you have to pay by subtracting the discount from the fee.
// O/P => The discount amount is INR ___ and final discounted fee is INR __
